   - Number should be clearly visible on placeholder image
   - Use consistent formatting

2. **Placeholder images:**
   - Generate simple gray rectangles with centered text
   - Include aspect ratio guidance (e.g., "16:9", "4:3", "portrait")

3. **Placeholder documentation:**
   - Create `PLACEHOLDER_GUIDE.md` listing all placeholders with:
     - Number
     - Page location
     - Purpose/description
     - Suggested dimensions
     - Aspect ratio

4. **Example placeholder:**
```html

     alt="PLACEHOLDER 001 - Hero image"
     class="hero-image">
```
